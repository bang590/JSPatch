                   JSPatch bridges Objective-C and JavaScript using the
                   Objective-C runtime. You can call any Objective-C class and
                   method in JavaScript by just including a small engine.
                   That makes the APP obtaining the power of script language:
                   add modules or replacing Objective-C codes to fix bugs dynamically.
