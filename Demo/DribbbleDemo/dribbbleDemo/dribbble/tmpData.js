It's been amazing to see your excitement for the creative possibilities and we can't wait to see how you use it. </p>\n\n<p>One of the best aspects of working on ads at Facebook is striving to find the sweet spot between the goals of our advertisers and those of people browsing their feed.

This is video directly from interacting with the native iOS app.</p>\n\n<p>Myself, <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/4777\">@Geof Crowl</a>, and Wes tackled the project in just 15 days. It was intense but fun. Geof and I did the design and helped with layout in Xcode using Nibs. Wes built the globe and the data visualizations from a json file using our own Open GL globe library we've been building on an off for the past year. </p>",

This is video directly from interacting with the native iOS app.</p>\n\n<p>Myself, <a href=\"https://dribbble.com/4777\">@Geof Crowl</a>, and Wes tackled the project in just 15 days. It was intense but fun. Geof and I did the design and helped with layout in Xcode using Nibs. Wes built the globe and the data visualizations from a json file using our own Open GL globe library we've been building on an off for the past year. </p>",
